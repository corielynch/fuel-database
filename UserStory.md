// Just an idea...So if we get lost...here is our end goal

Goal: Fuel inventory for better booklogs both for employees & employers. For tax purposes and business organization.

`
 AS A driver, at the pump, I am able to access the Fuel App and add my log of consumed fuel.
 AFTER I logged in the App, I am able to log my vehicle, fuel gallons, timestamp, & job description.
 THEN I am taken to a screen saying 'Data Uploaded'.
 THEN I am Prompted back to the login screen.
 THEN I can go to VIEW DATA to make sure my fuel log for the day was accurately logged into the system.
